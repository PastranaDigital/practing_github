# Practice with Lyrics

Today

All my troubles seemed so far away

Now it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh, I believe in yesterday

<br><br>

Suddenly

I'm not half the woman I used to be

There's a plant box hanging over me

Oh, yesterday I almost died suddenly


<br><br>


Why she had to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say

I said something very bad, now I long for yesterday


<br><br>

Tomorrow

Love'll be such an easy game to play

Now I need a place to run away

Oh, I believe in yesterday


<br><br>

Why she had to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say

I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

<br><br>


Yesterday

Love was such an easy game to play

Now I need a place to hide away

Oh, I believe in yesterday
